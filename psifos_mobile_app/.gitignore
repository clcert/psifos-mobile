# Uncomment to exclude the pubspec.lock file from version control
# It is generally recommended to version control this file, as it can help ensure
# that everyone working on the project is using compatible versions of dependencies.
# However, if your project has many developers, and a small number of dependency
# versions, it might be better to uncomment this line to avoid constant merge conflicts.
